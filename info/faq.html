<dd><P>
You only <EM>need</EM> a text editor. This is all explained in the <a
href="/tutorials/vrml97/en/tut11.html">Getting Started</A> VRML97 tutorial. However, if you
want to start serious content creation, there are a few tools that I can
recommend:
<ol>
<LI>A text editor, for raw content creation. I do 95% of my VRML creation in
<A HREF="http://www.parallelgraphics.com/products/vrmlpad/" target="_blank">VrmlPad</A>. There are links to
others on the <A HREF="/tools/index.php">tools</A> page.
<LI>A paint program, for textures. I recommend Paint Shop Pro from
<A HREF="http://www.jasc.com" target="_blank">JASC</A>.
<LI>A VRML validator, such as Chisel from <A HREF="http://www.trapezium.com" target="_blank">Trapezium</A>
This is vital for your content creation, especially if you're using a text
editor to do it. Browsers don't give helpful error messages, but this
will. If you have a problem in your world, this will find it. It will also
optimise your files and make them more efficient. It <EM>also</EM> does
GZIPing of VRML files for you.
<LI>A 3D Modeler, for the more complex IndexedFaceSet stuff. For this, I
use Nendo, from <A HREF="http://www.wingededge.com" target="_blank">Winged Edge Technologies</A>.
<LI>A Java compiler, for scripting. I would recommend Sun's own JDK (Java Development Kit),
available from <A HREF="http://java.sun.com" target="_blank">java.sun.com</A>. It's free, 
has everything you need and has plenty of handy features.
</ol>
So, what more do you need to create great VRML? Well,
imagination, of course, but there's no web site for that!
<P></P>
<dt><A NAME="caniusebmp"><STRONG>Can I use BMP/GIF/etc files as textures?</STRONG></A>
<dd>
<P>
In general, probably not. Your browser might support it, but it's not standard. Stick to the
standard .JPG and .PNG files.
</P>
<dt><A NAME="blackscreen"><STRONG>I've written my world, but when I load it into the browser I get a
black screen. What's wrong?</STRONG></A>
<dd>
<P>
This happens because the browser doesn't recognise what it has been told to load.
This is usually because you've forgotten to put the header at the top of the file. Remember, every
VRML file must have the magic header <CODE>#VRML V2.0 utf8</CODE> at the top of the file. 
If you have got this line, it is possible that the file is not in plain text format.
One of the more frequent reasons I find for this is that you've written your code in Wordpad and saved
it as a Microsoft Word document. If you just get a blank window when you try to view your worlds, load
them into Notepad and make sure they're plain text only. Better still, always use a plain text
editor to write VRML!
<P></P>
<dt><A NAME="writetoconsole"><STRONG>How can I write information to the VRML console?</STRONG></A>
<dd>
<P>
Some browsers have a function built into their Java and ECMAScript interpreters 
that allow a script to write values into the VRML Console (where errors 
and other messages are displayed). Some also allow you to write to the browser's Java console.
The functions that I know of so far for the different browsers are listed below. 
There is also more information  available in the <A HREF="/workshop/debug/index.html">debugging</A> workshop.

Usually, when people ask me how to create a certain thing in VRML, I write an entry for the <A HREF="/library">library</A>,
and then point them at that - take a look there first, and them <A HREF="mailto:&#103;&#117;&#105;&#100;e&#64;&#119;e&#98;&#51;&#100;g&#117;i&#100;&#101;&#46;&#111;&#114;g&#46;&#117;&#107;">mail me</A>
