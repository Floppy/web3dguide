<H1>How do I embed VRML into my web pages?</H1>
<P>
Quite often, you will want to embed VRML worlds into your web pages, for use as adverts, animations,
whatever. This is one of the nicest uses of VRML, in fact, as it allows complex animations with very
low download time. The main title on this site is a piece of embedded VRML, and it comes in total to
15k. The static JPG image that you get if you don't have a VRML plugin is 10k. As you can see, the
increase in size is very small for the amount of extra interest that you get.
</P><P>
This discussion of the site logo brings me to the main point of this workshop. It's easy to embed a
piece of VRML in a web page, you can just use the &lt;EMBED&gt; tag in your HTML documents, like so:
</P><PRE>
&lt;EMBED SRC="vrml.wrl"&gt;
</PRE><P>
This is all well and good, and that's the easy way to do it. However, what if someone doesn't have a
VRML plugin installed? What happens then? Well, they get a horrible "No Plugin" box in their page!
Very unattractive. On the main page of this site, I have a piece of code in the page that detects
whether the user has a plugin or not. If they do, the VRML world is shown. If not, it shows a normal
image! Much better, I'm sure you'll agree. So, how's it done?
</P><P>
Well, here we're just going to deal with the two major internet browsers, Internet Explorer and
Netscape, although it's quite expandable. Because web browsers are all so different from one
another (a fact that makes the serious web designers life hell), we have to detect the plugins in
different ways in different browsers. So, we're going to start by writing a detector function for
each browser first. At this point, it'll help your understanding if you've done some Javascript and
VBScript before, though it's not vital.
</P><P>
Let's start with Netscape, because it's easiest. In our HTML page, we put a Javascript function into
the &lt;HEAD&gt;, like so:
</P><PRE>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt;
&lt;!--
function DetectNetscape() {
	var retVal = 0;
	var version = parseFloat(navigator.appVersion);
	if (version>=3) {
		var plugin = navigator.mimeTypes["model/vrml"];
		if (plugin != null) {
			retVal = 1;
		}
	}
	return retVal;
}
// --&gt;
</PRE><P>
This function will detect a VRML plugin in Netscape, and return 1 if it finds one, and returns 0 if
not. First, it checks the version of the browser. This will only work in Netscape 3.0 or greater. If
that's OK, it checks a property of the <STRONG>navigator</STRONG> object called <EM>mimeTypes</EM>.
This is an array that stores all the MIME types that the browser can handle. We can search this by
putting the VRML MIME type, model/vrml, into the array offset. If there is a VRML plugin, the result
will be a reference to the plugin that handles the MIME type. If not, it will be null. Then, it's
just a simple check of this value to see if we have a plugin. Easy! Hmmm, now we get to the bit
that's just awkward. Microsoft Internet Explorer. Trust them to be difficult!
</P><P>
IE doesn't support the <EM>mimeTypes</EM> array, making life really difficult for us. We write
another function to check for Internet Explorer. This goes in the same &lt;SCRIPT&gt; block as the
Netscape function above.
</P><PRE>
function DetectIE() {
	var retVal = 0;
	var version = parseFloat(navigator.appVersion);
	if (version>=2) {
		var pluginArray = (new VBArray(GetPluginArray())).toArray();
		for (i = 0; i < pluginArray.length; i++) {
			if (pluginArray[i]==true) retVal = 1;
		}
	}
	return retVal;
}
</PRE><P>
This is fairly similar really. First, we check the version, and then we get some information from
the browser about it's plugins. However, IE doesn't support anything to do this in JavaScript, so we
have to write our own, in a fairly roundabout way. We write a VBscript function called
GetPluginArray() which checks for the presence of certain plugins. Unlike Netscape, we can't just
say "Can you do VRML?", we have to ask about each browser in turn. Awkward, eh? Anyway, here's the
GetPluginArray function, which also goes in the &lt;HEAD&gt;.
</P><PRE>
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="VBScript"&gt;
&lt;!--
function GetPluginArray()
	On error resume next
	pluginArray = Array(false,false,false,false)
	' Detect Cortona
	pluginArray(0) = NOT IsNull(CreateObject("Cortona.Control"))
	' Detect Blaxxun CC3D
	pluginArray(1) = NOT IsNull(CreateObject("blaxxunCC3D.blaxxunCC3D"))
	' Detect Cosmo Player 1 & 2
	pluginArray(2) = NOT IsNull(CreateObject("SGI.CosmoPlayer.1"))
	pluginArray(3) = NOT IsNull(CreateObject("SGI.CosmoPlayer.2"))
	' Detect Pivoron Player
	pluginArray(4) = NOT IsNull(CreateObject("Nexternet.NexternetPlayer.1"))
	' Return
	GetPluginArray = pluginArray
end function
// --&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</PRE><P>
Nice, isn't it? Hmmm. Anyway, what it does is creates an array of four values (I only know the names
for four browsers), and then tries to create an object for each browser it knows about. Then it
stores the result, true or false, into the array and returns it. It really is damn awkward. Each
browser has a unique name which we use in the CreateObject function call. To detect a plugin, you
have to know it's name. At the moment, I only know names for Cortona, Blaxxun, Cosmo and Pivoron, but if
anyone knows any more, please let me know and I'll put them in. Once we've created this array, we
can convert it to a JavaScript array with the <EM>var pluginArray = new
VBArray(GetPluginArray()).toArray();</EM> line, and then test each value in our Javascript function,
which then returns a 0 or 1 in the same way as before.
</P><P>
These three functions provide the infrastructure needed to intelligently embed VRML files in your
pages. All you need to do, whenever you want to embed VRML, is use the following block of code:
</P><PRE>
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt;
&lt;!--
var browser = navigator.appName;
var displayVRML = 0;

if (browser=="Netscape") displayVRML = DetectNetscape();
else if (browser=="Microsoft Internet Explorer") displayVRML = DetectIE();

if (displayVRML==1) {
	document.writeln('&lt;EMBED SRC="vrml.wrl"&gt;');
}
else {
	document.writeln('&lt;IMG SRC="image.gif"&gt;');
}
// --&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
&lt;NOSCRIPT&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC="image.gif"&gt;
&lt;/NOSCRIPT&gt;
</PRE><P>
All this does is check the browser name, and then call the appropriate function to detect the
plugin. If it finds one, it uses the &lt;EMBED&gt; to display a VRML world, otherwise it shows a
normal image. Notice the use of the &lt;NOSCRIPT&gt; tag to display an image if scripts cannot be
run for some reason. Also, the image will be displayed if the browser is not supported, meaning that
you will never get a nasty broken plugin symbol, or whatever.
</P><P>
Test out your browser now! <A HREF="detect.html">Click here</A> to see if you have a supported VRML
plugin. Feel free to use this technique in your own pages, and show people what VRML can do! Full
source is available to download in a <A HREF="detect.txt">text file</A> (more reliable than saving an
HTML document).
