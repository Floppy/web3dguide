<H1>How do I create 'dashboard' or 'HUD' geometry in my worlds?</H1>
<P>
One effect that can be useful in designing VRML worlds, and that also shows the approach to take
when designing, is the Heads Up Display (HUD) style geometry, variously know as dashboard geometry
and probably many other names. The general idea is to have geometry (objects) that follows the user
around the world, always staying fixed relative to him. This is useful for many effects. You could
have the dashboard of a car or plane, to give the appearance of driving around a world. You could
place controls for the world on a control panel that stays with the user. You could have a message
panel, like a pager, that is always visible.
</P><P>
So, how do we convince this geometry to follow the user? Well, first of all, we separate our world
into sections. If you think about it, there are two main sections to a world containing a HUD. The
first (and probably largest) section is the world itself. If you had no HUD this would be the entire
world. However, we need another section independent of this containing the HUD geometry. So, a good
way to start is to create the basic structure for our world. We will have top-level information and
a pair of grouping nodes, one for each part.

}  
</PRE><P>
OK. At the top, we have a few global objects which don't really fit in either category, such as the
<STRONG>NavigationInfo</STRONG> and <STRONG>WorldInfo</STRONG> nodes. Then we have a <STRONG>Group</STRONG> node that will contain
the real world objects. Then, we have a <STRONG>Transform</STRONG>, which will contain the HUD objects. Now we
need to think what we need in each section. Well, the real world is fairly easy. That is exactly the
same as any normal world, except contained within the Group node (strictly, the Group node isn't
necessary, but it makes things easier to explain and see). So, we're going to forget about the world
and concentrate on the HUD geometry.
</P><P>
The first thing we need in our HUD is a <STRONG>Viewpoint</STRONG>. Now, the <STRONG>Viewpoint</STRONG> can't actually
be inside the HUD <STRONG>Transform</STRONG>, because it would send the user spinning off forever as soon as
he moved, as you would get a loop of movements sending the user to infinity. So, we place the
<STRONG>Viewpoint</STRONG> outside the <STRONG>Transform</STRONG>. However, we need to give the <STRONG>Transform</STRONG> the appropriate
translation and rotation so that the HUD is in the correct position for the <STRONG>Viewpoint</STRONG>,
otherwise the user won't see it until he moves. The next thing to consider is the fact that we don't
want the HUD disappearing inside world objects. So, we need to make sure that the HUD is contained
within the avatars' bounding box. For more information on this, read up on the NavigationInfo node.
If you need a large HUD, it's a good idea to increase the avatar's size to surround it. This will
make sure that the avatar collides with an object (and so can go no closer) before the HUD
hits.
</P><P>
We've nearly got the complete structure of our HUD geometry. However, there's one more thing to
consider. If the objects are inside the avatar's buonding box, the browser will think that the user
has hit them and so will not allow him to move closer to them. As they are <EM>inside</EM> the user,
the user cannot move. So, we need to turn off collision detection with the HUD. This is done with a
<STRONG>Collision</STRONG> node with the collide field set to FALSE. So, this is the new structure of our HUD
geometry.
</P><PRE>
#HUD objects
DEF HUDVIEW Viewpoint {
	description "HUD View"
	position 0 0 10
}
DEF HUD Transform {
	translation 0 0 10
	children [
		DirectionalLight {
			ambientIntensity 0.8
		}
		Collision {
			collide FALSE
			children [
				# Actual HUD objects go in here
			]
		}  
	]
}  
</PRE><P>
So, we have our HUD. I've put some lighting in there as well, otherwise with the headlight of you
won't see it, which is no good. So, you put your HUD geomety inside the <STRONG>Collision</STRONG> node,
making sure it is sufficiently close to the user to be enclosed inside the avatar.
</P><P>
Now, how do we make it move with the user. Well, the best way to do this is to have a 
<STRONG>ProximitySensor</STRONG> at the global level. This will pick up the user's movements, generating
events when he moves. These positions will be in the global system, suitable for ROUTEing to the HUD
<STRONG>Transform</STRONG>. The <STRONG>ProximitySensor</STRONG> also picks up changes in orientation, so these can be
routed to the <STRONG>Transform</STRONG> as well. Also, we will move the centre of the sensor as the user
moves, so he can never move out of it. The ProximitySensor can therefore be quite small, as long as
we position is in the same place as the user. The <STRONG>ProximitySensor</STRONG> with routing looks like this:
</P><PRE>
DEF SENSOR ProximitySensor {
	size 10 10 10
	center 0 0 10
}

ROUTE SENSOR.orientation_changed TO HUD.set_rotation
ROUTE SENSOR.position_changed TO HUD.set_translation
ROUTE SENSOR.position_changed TO SENSOR.set_center
</PRE>
<P>
The events sent out from the sensor give us a global position and orientation for the user, which we
feed back into the HUD <STRONG>Transform</STRONG>. This gives us geometry that always follows the user. And that, as
they say, is it!
</P><P>
You can take a look at the <A HREF="hud.wrl" TARGET=_new>result</A> here, and take a look at the full <A
HREF="hud.html">source</A> as well. The red, green and blue objects are in the real world,
while the purple square is inside the HUD, so moves with the user.
