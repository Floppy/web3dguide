<P>
This page is a tutorial of a sort, but it takes a slightly different approach from the VRML97
Tutorial that you've all probably read by now. It is a collection of workshops that deal
with getting results from VRML. It's not like the tutorial, which deals exclusively with the
language itself. It is more focused on what you can do using VRML. So, less teaching VRML, more
showing you how to <EM>use</EM> VRML to create what you want.

<FONT FACE='Arial'><STRONG><A HREF="embed/index.html">How do I embed VRML into my web pages?</A></STRONG></FONT><BR>
At some point, you'll almost certainly want to embed VRML inside an HTML page. That's easy, but this
workshop deals with intelligent embedding, so that users are never confronted with a 'plugin
required' message.

<FONT FACE='Arial'><STRONG><A HREF="hud/">How do I create 'dashboard' or 'HUD' geometry in my worlds?</A></STRONG></FONT><BR>
If you want to display some information to the user at all times, you'll need a way to keep shapes
in the same position on the screen at all times. This workshop explains how to create 'HUD' (Heads-Up
Display) geometry that stays still relative to the user as he or she moves.

<FONT FACE='Arial'><STRONG><A HREF="debug/">How can I debug VRML events and scripts?</A></STRONG></FONT><BR>
Debugging events can be difficult, especially when you're working in a number of different browsers
at once. This workshop gives a few pointers on how to debug event chains and scripts in VRML.

<FONT FACE='Arial'><STRONG><A HREF="floor/">How do I create an infinite textured floor?</A></STRONG></FONT><BR>
If you want to create a floor that goes on forever, without having infintely large polygons, this
workshop will show you how to create a seemingly infinite textured floor that actually moves with the user.

<FONT FACE='Arial'><STRONG><A HREF="teleporter/">How can link a URL to a location in my world?</A></STRONG></FONT><BR>
Often, instead of linking a URL to an object, using the Anchor node, you want the user to go to a
different URL when he or she walks to a particular place in your world. This workshop goes through
the process of creating a teleporter that does exactly that.

<FONT FACE='Arial'><STRONG><A HREF="php-vrml/">How do I create VRML with PHP?</A></STRONG></FONT><BR>
PHP is becoming very popular for generating dynamic HTML websites. However, you don't just have to
stick to boring old 2D - take database-driven websites into the third dimension with PHP and VRML.
