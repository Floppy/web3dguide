<H1>How do I create an infinite textured floor?</H1>
<P>
In your worlds, you may want to create an infinite floor plane, stretching off in all directions as
far as the user can travel. This workshop is going to go through the stages of creating such a
surface, and then making sure the texturing works right.
</P><P>
First, imagine you have a world, in which there are a number of objects, and a floor plane. For the
purposes of this workshop, we're going to work with a flat floor plane made out of a simple
<STRONG>Box</STRONG> node. You can make more complex floors easily with the <STRONG>ElevationGrid</STRONG> node, but
they will be more complex to make infinite. For the moment, let's assume we want a world with a flat
floor plane.
</P><P>
'Simple!' you may shout, I'll just create a <EM>huge</EM> <STRONG>Box</STRONG> that extends further than the
user will ever want to go. Well, there are a couple of disadvantages to that approach:
</P><OL>
<LI>You might get a really adventurous visitor, who decides to head off a light-year into the
distance, where your <STRONG>Box</STRONG> runs out.
<LI>Texturing such a huge object is going to give you problems in some way, either with a huge
texture or a silly <STRONG>TextureTransform</STRONG>.
<LI>Drawing the enourmous triangles that make up the object is bound to put a strain on your browser.
</OL><P>
There has to be a better way, so let's start thinking about it. First of all, let's create a simple
world to try out our ideas on. We'll have a small ground plane, about 100 metres square, with a
checkered texture on. We'll also have a few structures in the world, to give us an idea of how
everything's moving. Take a look at this <A HREF="floor1.wrl" TARGET=_new>first world</A> and its
<A HREF="floor1.html">code</A>, and get familiar with its layout and content.
</P><P>
The structures are just <STRONG>Sphere</STRONG>s, and the floor is just a <STRONG>Box</STRONG>. The texture is done with
a single black & white checkered 128x128 PNG file, as shown below, but scaled down with a
<STRONG>TextureTransform</STRONG>. The image is 128x128 because it's always a good idea to keep texture sizes
to a power of 2. The hardware prefers it that way, apparently.
</P><P>
<IMG SRC="floor.gif" ALT="Floor" WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=128 BORDER=1>
</P><P>
OK, now we have our world, how are we going to improve it? Well, the first problem is that the user
can walk off the edge of the floor. This is no good at all in an infinite floor, is it? So, what can
we do. Well, we use the same technique as we used for the heads-up display, for making stuff move
with the user, with a slight modification. If you haven't read the HUD workshop, <A
HREF="../hud/index.html">have a read</A> now, you'll need to understand what's going on.
</P><P>
As for the HUD, we first of all need to detect the user's position in the world. This then needs to
be fed into a <STRONG>Transform</STRONG> governing the position of the user-following geometry, in this case
the floor. So, we add a ProximitySensor that follows the user, as explained in the previous workshop.
However, we don't want the normal HUD behaviour exactly. When
the user moves, we want the floor to follow him in the X and Z directions, but not the Y. So, we
can't use the <EM>position_changed</EM> eventOut from the sensor to feed directly into the
<STRONG>Transform</STRONG>, we have to add a little bit of scripting. We're also not going to bother dealing
with the orientation of the user, as it turns out not to be necessary in the end. So, we need a
script that removes the Y component of an SFVec3f event. This is fairly simple...
</P><PRE>
DEF FLOORPROC Script {
   eventIn SFVec3f set_position
   eventOut SFVec3f translation_changed
   url "javascript:
      function set_position(value,time) {
         translation_changed.x = value.x;
         translation_changed.z = value.z;
      }
   "
}
</PRE><P>
This piece of code simply makes a new vector with the same X and Z values, but a Y value of 0. So,
whenever the user moves, the floor will move with him, staying at the same Y position but moving in
X and Z. Now we have all this in place, take a look at the <A HREF="floor2.wrl" TARGET=_new>second
world</A> and its <A HREF="floor2.html">code</A>. In the code, notice the large
<STRONG>ProximitySensor</STRONG>, the <STRONG>Script</STRONG> and the ROUTEs that have been added. In the world itself,
notice how the floor moves with the user, even when the user moves up into the air.
</P><P>
Now, we have something of a strange effect here. The floor moves with the user, creating an infinite
surface, but the texture does not. Also, we can still see the edges of our small piece of floor.
We'll deal with these now. First, we add a <STRONG>Fog</STRONG> node to disguise the edge of the <STRONG>Box</STRONG>.
If you don't want to do this, you could use a <STRONG>Cylinder</STRONG> instead of a <STRONG>Box</STRONG> to get rid of
the visible corners. However, using fog also removes nasty aliasing effects of the floor texture. If
you look at the first world, you'll see some nasty effects towards the edge of the <STRONG>Box</STRONG> as you
move around; the fog obscures these, making your world more realistic. Now for the texture.
</P><P>
Notice that the <STRONG>TextureTransform</STRONG> we're using has a translation field, which takes a 2D
translation for the texture on the surface. We could probably feed the same translation information
(with a bit of processing) into the <STRONG>TextureTransform</STRONG> as we fed into the main floor
<STRONG>Transform</STRONG>. Our updated script looks like this:
</P><PRE>
DEF FLOORPROC Script {
   eventIn SFVec3f set_position
   eventOut SFVec3f translation_changed
   eventOut SFVec2f textureTranslation_changed
   url "javascript:
      function set_position(value,time) {
         translation_changed.x = value.x;
         translation_changed.z = value.z;
         textureTranslation_changed.x = value.x / 100;
         textureTranslation_changed.y = -value.z / 100;
      }
   "
}
</PRE><P>
We need to invert the Z value, because of how we've positioned our box, and divide each component by 100
to allow for the fact that the texture is mapped onto an area that is 100 by 100 before being scaled
down.
</P><P>
Now that you understand that, take a look at the <A HREF="floor3.wrl" TARGET=_new>final world</A> in
our sequence, and its <A HREF="floor3.html">code</A>. Notice the expanded script, the DEF name for
the <STRONG>TextureTransform</STRONG> and the extra ROUTE. In the world, see how the texture appears to stay
still as the user moves. You can check this by going up to one of the spheres and walking around it
very slowly. You will see that the texture stays perfectly still relative to the real-world objects,
giving a perfect illusion of an infinite, seamlessly-textured plane.
