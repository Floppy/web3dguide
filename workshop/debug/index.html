<H1>How can I debug VRML events and scripts?</H1>
<P>
Over the last few weeks, I'm been doing some quite heavy scripting in VRML, ECMAScript and Java. One
of the things I've found is that it can be quite awkward to find a way to debug scripts and event
chains in different browsers. In normal programming, you can trace values as you go througb your
program, and find out where the errors are occuring. The problem is that VRML has no fixed way of
writing text output. In this workshop, we're going to develop a way to get around this problem.
</P><P>
The simplest way to write text output is to write it to the VRML Console. Most browser have a
console window that they write error messages and other information into. You can use this to output
information from inside scripts. Cosmo Player, for instance, allows you to write to the console
using the <EM>print()</EM> function in ECMAScript and the <EM>Browser.print()</EM> function in Java. I'm
going to use these throughout this workshop. It may be that your browser doesn't support them. If
this is the case, we're going to create a debugging method that doesn't use these later on.
Otherwise, you can look up the function used by your browser in the release ntoes that came with it
or in the <A HREF="/info/faq.html">FAQ</A> section of this site.
</P><P>
These print functions take strings as arguments, although most of the time they can also convert
data to strings automatically. So, you can write something like
</P><PRE>
print("vector: ");
print(vector);
</PRE><P>
or
</P><PRE>
print("vector: " + vector);
</PRE><P>
in most cases. So, the simplest way to debug a script is to use the built-in print functions to
write to the console. We can now use this to write a node that acts as an event debugger for
standard VRML files. A few people have asked for a way to tell what events are being sent and when,
in an effort to debug animation and interaction in their worlds. Well, now we're going to create a
node that will do it for you.
</P><P>
What we want to do is create a node that will sit in an event chain and pass events through it, but
also writes the value and time of that event to the console. So, the first thing that we'll need is
a PROTO definition for our debug node. I'm going to concentrate on debugging an SFTime event chain,
but just change the types and it'll work perfectly well for any VRML type. So, the PROTO:
</P><PRE>
PROTO SFTimeDebugger [
   eventIn  SFTime input
   eventOut SFTime output
]
</PRE><P>
So, this will give us a definition of a new node with one input and one output.
Now, we need to implement it. This is done
with a very simple piece of ECMAScript. If your browser doesn't support ECMAScript, try substituting
<EM>"vrmlscript:</EM> for <EM>"javascript:</EM>. Right, here we go...
</P><PRE>
{
   Script {
      eventIn  SFTime input           IS input
      eventOut SFTime output          IS output
      url "javascript:
         function input(value,time) {
            print(value);
            output = value;
         }
      "
   }
}
</PRE><P>
And that's it! Simple. The script will print the value, and then output the value so that the event
chain can continue. All you do is plug it in between an event's source and destination, and watch
the values come tumbling out.
</P><P>
Now, this is all well and good if you've got a print() function that works, but what if you don't?
What if you've got a browser that doesn't have any way of writing to the console from a script?
Then, surely, you're done for. But no, help is at hand. Now, we're going to forget our reliance on a
print function and design a debugging console that works purely in VRML. This also has the advantage
that you can have both your world and the console visible and active at the same time. How? Yes, you
guessed it, we're going to recycle the HUD technology from the previous workshop and create a small
text display that is permanently present in front of you actually in your virtual world. Before we
do that, though, we're going to need an event debugger that can write either to the console or give
a string output, otherwise we won't be able to get any output onto our console. We simply expand the
old <STRONG>SFTimeDebugger</STRONG> by adding another eventOut to carry the strings we want to print. I'm also
going to add a couple of fields to allow you to set the output style for the node.
</P><PRE>
PROTO SFTimeDebugger [
   eventIn  SFTime   input
   field    SFBool   consoleOutput   TRUE
   field    SFBool   stringOutput    TRUE
   eventOut SFString debugString
   eventOut SFTime   output
]
{
   Script {
      eventIn  SFTime   input           IS input
      field    SFBool   consoleOutput   IS consoleOutput
      field    SFBool   stringOutput    IS stringOutput
      eventOut SFString debugString     IS debugString
      eventOut SFTime   output          IS output
      url "javascript:
         function input(value,time) {
            if (consoleOutput) print(value);
            if (stringOutput) debugString = value.toString();
            output = value;
         }
      "
   }
}
</PRE><P>
As you can see, this new event debugger gives you the option of writing the value that passes
through it into either the console (if <EM>consoleOutput</EM> is TRUE) or a string output event (if
<EM>stringOutput</EM> is TRUE). This is only a little more complex than the previous version, and it
makes everything a lot more flexible. The file with this PROTO in is available as <A
HREF="SFTimeDebugger.wrl">SFTimeDebugger.wrl</A> for you to use and adapt.
</P><P>
Right then, now we need to create something that will take these string events and display them on
our own VRML console. First of all we need the PROTO for the node.
</P><PRE>
PROTO DebugConsole [
   eventIn SFString nextString
   field   SFVec3f  offset       0.11 0 -0.2
]
</PRE><P>
This is pretty simple, isn't it? We've just got an input for the strings we want to display, an
offset for the position of the console (which is by default in the correct position on a normal
screen), and that's it. Well, as you've probably guessed, it's not so simple inside. Inside is that
same sort of arragement we had before in the HUD workshop (<A HREF="../hud/index.html">have a read</A> if you
haven't already). However, the interesting bits come in the script inside the console. You can have
a look at the complete <A HREF="DebugConsole.html">code</A>, or download the <A
HREF="DebugConsole.wrl">DebugConsole.wrl</A> file containing the complete PROTO for the node. In the
meantime, let's look at the script.
</P><PRE>
DEF CONTROLLER Script {
   eventIn  SFString input IS nextString
   eventIn  SFTime   clear
   field    MFString contents []
   eventOut MFString output
   url "javascript:
      function initialize() {
         contents = new MFString('DebugConsole v1.0');
         output = contents;
      }
      function input(value, time) {
         var length = contents.length;
         if (length > 25) {
            for (i=0; i<25; i++) {
               contents[i] = contents[i+1];
            }
            contents[25] = value;
         }
         else {
            contents[length] = value;
         }
      }
      function clear(value, time) {
         contents = new MFString();
      }
      function eventsProcessed() {
         output = contents;
      }
   "
}
</PRE><P>
The text display is implemented as a <STRONG>Text</STRONG> node, which contains a MFString field with the text
in. So, to set the text on the console, we simply need to assign an MFString value to the output,
which is ROUTEd within the console to the <EM>string</EM> field. So, when we start the script, we make
the text say a little bit of information about the console by making a new MFString and assigning it
to the output. The same is done when the <EM>clear</EM> eventIn is activated, except this one creates an
empty MFString.
</P><P>
The current contents of the string are stored in the <EM>contents</EM> field. So, when we receive a
new string to display, we need to determine whether it can just be added at the end or whether
everything else needs to be scrolled upwards. The maximum length is 26 strings, so if the length is
less than or equal to 25, we're OK and can just add the string at the end. Otherwise, we need to go
through the entire list of strings, copying the next string in the list into each position, thus
scrolling the lines up. The new item can then be added at the end in position 25. The actual
contents object is only sent out in the <EM>eventsProcessed()</EM> function, as this is normally
called once per frame, which is the only time we need to update the screen.
</P><P>
So, that should all make sense to you. You can take a look at the <A
HREF="DebugTest.wrl" TARGET=_new>results</A> here (along with the world's <A HREF="DebugTest.html">code</A>).
As you can see, this test world is debugging the values sent from a simple <STRONG>TimeSensor</STRONG>. Also,
the console moves with the user, so it always remains in view. There is one problem with the
console, in that it will drop the frame rate of your worlds a fair amount, as there is a lot more
geometry to render, with all the text and everything.
</P><P>
Please feel free to use both the SFTimeDebugger and the DebugConsole if you need to, I only hope
they're of some use to you.
